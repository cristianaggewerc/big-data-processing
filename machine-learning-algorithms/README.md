# Comparison of Different Machine Learning Algorithms on Big Data	

## Description

   1) `predict-rain-in-australia.ipynb`

   Predicting rain or weather is a common problem in machine learning. Different machine learning algorithms can be used to model and predict rainfall. In this project, the main goal is to predict whether there will be rain tomorrow or not. In
particular, I have applied the tools of machine learning to visualize and
predict the possibility of rainfall in Australia. 

   Models tested: `DecisionTreeClassifier()`, `RandomForestClassifier()`, and
`LogisticRegression()`, `GBTClassifier()` methods in spark to calculate the probability of the
rain fall tomorrow based on the other related data points (e.g., temperature, wind,
humidity).

## Data
- `weatherAUS.csv`: Rain in Australia

The dataset is originally from Kaggle Dataset and can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). It has been modified to serve our purpose i.e. (to do the binary classification).
